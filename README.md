# Connection Zone

This application was developed by Flinders University students in collaboration with Uniting*Care* Wesley Bowden Inc. (UCWB).

The application is designed to provide an easier way for potential clients to understand what Financial Health Services UCWB can provide them, as well as an easier and faster way to assess their eligibility for these services. Clients otherwise tend to contact the UCWB hotline which is a slower process for clients as well as taking essential resources away from UCWB which could be better used.

Users are also provided with details for other service providers (no matter if eligible or ineligible for UCWB services) as a means of ensuring users can still be provided with the support they need.
